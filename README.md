# weatherDash
The goal for this challenge is to create a weather dashboard that will showcase current and future weather conditions for different cities. To build this dashboard, I used a third party API called OpenWeather to access specific data points by initating a Fetch request. Using the API allowed me to pull in information such as the temperature, the humidity and the wind speed. I presented this information to the user each time they searched for a city and added that city to the search history.
